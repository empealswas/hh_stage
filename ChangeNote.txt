Release Changes 30-09-2023:
    1. In the section where you create the assessments – can we reduce the space between the current assessments and the section to create new questions.
    2. In the class reports, it is not showing all the teams in the organisation for example in the test school, the drop only gives the option for primary 1 but not for primary 2.
    3. In the class report can you disable the Download Full Class Report button until a class has been selected otherwise, we need an error message.
    4. In the assessment reports, when you are generating new reports for someone who has an assessment completed – can we remove the buttons for Previous Report and Next Report
    5. The sleep data for the user dashboard seems to be taking a lot more time than the other data, is there a reason for this (Mark has asked if there is a lot of sleep data in the Postgres database)
    6. Can you send Mark an explanation of why we needed the Cron job to move data from DynamoDB to PostgreSQL?
